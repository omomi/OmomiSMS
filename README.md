The OMOMI SMS service enable us to reach users that may not have access to the OMOMI web and mobile platforms.
Since almost every woman of child-bearing age in Nigeria has access to a mobile phone that can receive SMS,
we are able to provide users subscribed to this service critical health information.

The OMOMI SMS service 'walks' a pregnant woman through her entire pregrnancy journey - from 5 weeks of pregnancy till delivery.
Mothers with children from ages 0 through 5 are also covered by our service.

The repo contains content of some of our messages sent to these group of users (pregnant women and mothers) in a JSON format.
The algorithms that dispatches the SMS to the users computes the right message to send based on the age of the foetus (for pregnant women) or age of the child (for mothers).
